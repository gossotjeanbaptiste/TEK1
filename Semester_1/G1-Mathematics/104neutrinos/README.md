# 104neutrinos

A distinguished nuclear physics researcher and their assistant are studying neutrinos, a kind of
promising particle, and are trying to prove that these particles can travel faster than light.
Given temperature and pressure conditions, they record the speed of some particles under these
conditions, modify one parameter, and start again. Almost 11 months of hard work on several
hundreds of millions records...
They are unable to efficiently store all of these values. For each series of records, they only register:
1. its arithmetical mean,
2. its standard deviation,
3. its root mean square (they need an average speed so that if all the particles travel at this
speed, they would have the same total kinetic energy, which writes 1
2mv2),
4. its harmonic mean (as a precaution, in case they would need another variable, with a non-quadratic dependency on speed).

Considering the size of the series, they need you to develop a software that will allow them to up-
date their data in real-time. This program will take 4 numbers as inputs (the number of recorded
values, their arithmetic mean, harmonic mean and standard deviation), and must:

1. wait for the next value to be written on the standard input,
2. print the number of recorded values, their standard deviation, arithmetic mean, root mean
square and harmonic mean,
1. return to the first step, except if the keyword END is entered.
