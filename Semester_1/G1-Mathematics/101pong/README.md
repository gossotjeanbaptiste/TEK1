# 101pong

The goal of this project is to work on a 3D version of this game (or of the Breakout game.. .). Only one paddle will be considered, located in the ($Oxy$) plane (which is defined by the equation $z = 0$).

Your program must print:
- The velocity vector of the ball,
- The coordinates of the ball after a given amount of time,
- The angle at which the ball will hit the paddle (if it will actually hit it, at anytime from t = 0)
