# Organized

Objectives
You need to be able to store and sort all the materials you have at your fingertips.
Your laboratory is really upside down and you need to organize it. This project can be divided
into 2 parts:
- Storing and handling hardware
- Sorting your stuff according to tags

In fact, there’s a third challenge! You’re going to be handling a lot of hardware and your sorting
algorithm needs to be able to process a large quantity of hardware quickly and efficiently.
